A few weeks ago, I received an email from Academia.edu asking whether the paper “Technical Guideline for Structural Design of Temporary Tsunami Shelter” was my publication or not.

I was one of the co-authors. Although it might sound impressive, it really isn’t.

The way we made the guideline wasn’t by actually thinking of what would be the best guideline for designing a temporary tsunami shelter. But, we literally just translated a similar (actually, the same!) guide written by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) of the US. We just translated the guideline into the Indonesian language and converted the units into SI.

What was more embarrassing was the fact that this was a standard practice done in Indonesia for any technical guidelines, codes, and other similar products. We didn’t invent original regulations. We just copied them from other countries.

Was this wrong? Probably not so much. It might be better for us to just copy because I don’t believe that we have good enough human resources that can make a good enough concrete code like the one from the ACI (American Concrete Institute). They are more well-funded and weaponed with robust researches on related subjects. Those things make their code one of the most comprehensive, practical, and safe codes for concrete design practices. We didn’t have a capacity to match that.

But the lack of originality in these aspects can still be very worrying if considering that some of the regulations are related to specifications of certain products or materials. For instance, if you follow a UK regulation, most likely they’ll adjust their code to products that are from or, at least, available in the UK (that just makes sense for them). If Indonesia just blatantly copied the UK regulation, the entire industry in Indonesia will be indirectly forced into using and buying UK products.

Making their own laws is also the reason why countries fight for their independence. That's why copying other country's laws seem very ironic—it defeats the basic purpose of having an independent country.

I’m also thinking about what are the things that are implemented in Indonesia that were not originally intended, but instead a byproduct of the practice of blatantly copying other countries’ laws without really checking why they made them in the first place. Are our values really the same (even similar are still not acceptable here!) with those countries? What’s the point of having an independent country if we can't even make our own rules?
