I just watched the football match between Indonesia and Singapore, and the whole thing made me questioned one thing: “what does an OKR of a football coach (or it can be any sports, really) look like?”

The game ended 4-2 for Indonesia’s win after some dramas including a missed penalty and 3 red cards for Singapore. The match itself was full of referee errors (according to my amateurish observation). Singapore’s #21 shouldn’t be booked the first yellow (he got red carded 10 minutes later). Indonesia’s second goal—the one that secured them a draw and led the game to the extra time—was supposed to be offside. These errors completely dictated the outcome of the game.

How can the Singapore’s coach explain such a lost? Would unfair referee be an acceptable explanation? 

I genuinely believe that the OKRs wouldn't work in sports. The reasons are because (1) most of the objectives in sports would naturally be winning something (like a game or a tournament), or achieving something by winning (like finishing top 4 in the league); and (2) I don't see any key results that can guarantee winning in a [zero-sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) environment like sports.

Here's [an example](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okr-examples-and-how-to-write-them) that John Doerr's team provided on their website.

Objective: __Win the World Cup__\
Key Result #1: Average scored goals rate of 2.0 throughout the tournament.\
Key Result #2: Average conceded goals rate of 0.5 throughout the tournament.\
Key Result #3: Ball possession rate of 75%.

I don’t think that’s how you win a World Cup. Good stats alone don't guarantee you winning in sports. I mean, if all of the key results above was accomplished but you didn't win the World Cup, would you still call that a success?
