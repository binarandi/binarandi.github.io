Here I am, making a new blog. Again.

There is something different about each of my blogs. Each one carries different theme, different vibe. I'm hoping this one, too, will bring something different. Something I've never _achieved_ before.

The closest version of what I want this blog to be is probably [my Tumblr](https://ghazi.tumblr.com/). But now without pictures or videos. Just words, pure words.

I remember the time when I pushed myself to write on my Tumblr every day in a month, and succeeded. I want to do it again — probably not daily, but I want the least amount of frictions on writing as possible. No, I'm not talking about Twitter because I want to be able to express more complex thoughts, too. Also, the way how easy for everyone to comment on whatever the things I write on Twitter made me uncomfortable. Blogs are still the best because I need a method to communicate in one direction.

I hope you are joining my journey. Welcome.
