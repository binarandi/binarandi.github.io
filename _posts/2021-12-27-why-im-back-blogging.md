I find writing therapeutic. I often wrote in my journal when I wasn't blogging. But there's something different about sharing your thoughts on the world wide web. To me, blog is the perfect medium because it doesn't attract too much attention (like Twitter) but you still allow others to read it (unlike journal).

I often think about Da Vinci's notebooks. The fact that there's a great chance that those notebooks could be just lost forever and never discovered by the world is mind-boggling to me. No one would understand what a great man Da Vinci was. We probably would still recognize him as a great artist and, to some extent, a great engineer, but the scientist Da Vinci was, in my opinion, the best version of Da Vinci.

Think about it, how many "lost Da Vinci" we had in the world? How many people who were just as brilliant as Da Vinci (or even more!) that the world never really knew because of various reasons. Maybe they kept their notebooks as a secret. Maybe they burned them.

Or, maybe they just never wrote! They didn't immortalize their brilliance in the form of writing, so the next generations would never learn from their thoughts. Remember, until only recently (in the context relative to the entire timeline of the history of mankind) (before the invention of audio and video recording), writing was the only medium to capture and preserve your thoughts.

I bet we had a lot of them, and that's just unfortunate.

I knew that journaling was not an easy thing to do. You need a very strong internal motive to consistently write in journals, which probably explains why most people don't do it.

The clear benefit that I experienced from journaling is it helps me to think more clearly. Writing is hard, and a part of why it's hard is because, to write, you need to first think in a structured manner, which I don't see as the default case. After you have a structured thought, you need to be able to _translate_ those thoughts into written passages. It's a complex process, something that we don't often appreciate in a glimpse. 

But, writing is powerful because it can be read by other people. You can convey your idea to others, and not many greater feelings in the world than to feel accepted. In fact, that's probably the most important point of writing. To be read by others! That's why sharing it is probably the best way. If I only write in journals, none will read it and I think the alternative is better.

I'm blogging again so that I can share as much things, ideas, thoughts to the world. I try not to make it too complex. I try to only use plain English. It's the best for both the readers and me as the writer. I want as many people as possible to be able to access my writings, and I also want the least amount of barriers for me to write.

I don't think the world want another "lost Da Vinci."
